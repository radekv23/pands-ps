# program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
# At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two,
#  but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.

positive = input(int("Enter posivive value:"))

    positive = positive / 2
elif:
    odd = (positive *3) + 1
break positive == 1
